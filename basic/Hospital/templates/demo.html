    <u><i><b>The average website includes several different HTML pages.</u></i></b>, For instance, 
    a home page, an about page, and a contact page would all have separate HTML files.
    HTML documents are files that end with a .html or .htm extension.
     A web browser reads the HTML file and renders its content so that internet
      users can view it.
